        "plainLyrics": "The moon went behind a petro-chemical plant\nI had a feeling I didn't understand\nI was shivering on crutches\nMore dead than alive\nIt was Christmas 1985\nIt was the night they let me out of the home\nIt was the night I caught the bus on my own\nAnd the city slithered past the windows\nLike a film that was just beginning\nI was so excited I nearly missed my stop\nIt was quarter to ten\nI was hopelessly lost\nI arrived pretty late\nBut you didn't seem to mind\nWe are not the first\nBut we are golden tonight\nLike two little children\nUnder the covers\nAdrift in the night\nWith the universe above us\nAnd I'll be the dad\nAnd you be the mum\nAnd we'll make out we know what it is that we've done\nBut whatever it is\nI know, that it's only just beginning, yeah\nTrying so, so hard\nTo act just like a grown up\nAnd it's so, so hard\nAnd we're hoping that we don't get shown up\n'Cause everybody wants to grow up\nFinally part of the new generation\nFinally part of the pub conversation\nAnd somehow this leads to mature life decisions\nLike the one that I heard of from Jeremy Sissons\nWho said he, he moved near the motorway\n'Cause it was good for commuting\nAnd I laughed in his face\nBecause I, I thought he was joking\nBut then I, I looked in his eyes\nAnd I saw, he was not joking\nNo, he was trying\nTrying so, so hard\nTo act just like a grown up\nAnd it's so, so hard\nAnd we're hoping that we don't get shown up\n'Cause everybody's got to grow up\nEverybody?\nAre you sure?\nAnd so you move from Camden\nOut to Hackney\nAnd you stress about wrinkles\nInstead of acne\nAnd you forget about Tina\nGet in a bad mood\nAnd buy a computer\nAnd soon it will be time\nFor some more food\nUh, yeah, uh-uh, eh\nAnd later that first night\nI had a dream that a new planet had been discovered\nAnd through powerful telescopes\nWe could see the inhabitants\nAnd they seemed to be having a really good time\nSo we built a rocket\nAnd I was on it\nThey put us in a state of suspended animation\nFor the duration of the journey\nAnd when we landed on that distant planet\nWe all woke up\nAnd we discovered that we'd all lost our memories\nAnd we looked back at the planet we'd just come from\nAnd everyone there seemed to be having a really good time\nBut we couldn't return\nBecause the rocket no longer had enough fuel left in it\nWhy am I telling you this story?\nI don't remember\nWhy did Mowgli decide to come out of the jungle?\nTo play doctors and nurses\nAnd Aunties and uncles\nAnd cavaliers and round heads\nAnd tarts and vicars\nPlaying all night\nTo get in somebody's Knickers\nAnd I am not ageing\nNo, I am just ripening\nAnd life's too short to drink bad wine and that's frightening\nAnd it's nearly sunset\nAnd we haven't had lunch yet\nAnd I'm sorry for asking\nBut are we having fun yet?\nSo, so hard\nTo act just like a grown up\nAnd it's so, so hard\nAnd we're hoping that we don't get shown up\n'Cause nobody wants to grow up\nOne last sunset\nOne final blaze of glory\nAnd I know it's all about the journey\nNot the final destination\nBut what if you get travel sick\nBefore you've even left the station?",
